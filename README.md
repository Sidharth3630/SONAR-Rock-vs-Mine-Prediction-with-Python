# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-with-Python
:  🛰️ SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction – Machine Learning Project  This project predicts whether an object detected by SONAR signals is a rock or a mine using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset contains 60 sonar frequency features used to classify underwater objects based on reflected signals.
